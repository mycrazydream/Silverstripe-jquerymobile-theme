This is a modified version of the theme that comes with the regular silverstripe-mobile module

This is a base theme only and you should change the jquery and jquerymin.css for your own by visiting http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/

Extensive use is made of the data-rel tag to ensure that the query mobile knows where deeply nested links are.

You might find it necessary (it certainly was before the data-rel mods) to put this in your page.php (top part) to ensure that image links are root relative.

    protected function onBeforeWrite() {
        parent::onBeforeWrite();
        $this->Content = str_replace(' src="assets/', ' src="/assets/', $this->Content);

        
    }
Try to put your normal css calls in the regular template to stop them being called as well

I am thinking of added a test for mobile in page.php to make things happen sooner and control requirements better

Dont forget to add a switch back from your regular template by using a test in the silverstripe-mobile module
